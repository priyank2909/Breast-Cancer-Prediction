## 1) Overview

The Breast Cancer Prediction Project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the likelihood of an individual having or developing breast cancer. This project utilizes data analytics and machine learning techniques to aid in early detection, diagnosis, and personalized treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## 2) Features

1) Data Integration: Combines data from various sources including medical records, diagnostic imaging, genetic information, and pathology reports.
2) Predictive Modeling: Implements multiple machine learning models to predict the likelihood of breast cancer.
3) Model Evaluation: Uses comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
4) Ethical Considerations: Ensures patient data privacy and addresses potential biases in the models.

## 3) Modeling Techniques

1) Logistic Regression: For predicting the probability of a binary outcome.
2) Random Forests: For classification based on feature values.
3) Support Vector Machines (SVM): For finding the optimal hyperplane that separates classes.
4) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For classifying data points based on the 'k' nearest neighbors.

## 4) Evaluation Metrics 

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

## 5) Installation

1) Clone the repository:
- Copy code

        git clone (https://github.com/priyank2909/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git)
  
2) Install the required dependencies:
- Copy code

        pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

## 6) Usage

Prepare the input data:
Ensure you have the necessary dataset file (e.g., breast_cancer.csv) in the appropriate directory.
